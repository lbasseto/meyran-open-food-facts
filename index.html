					the center of multiple <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/39492207">controversies</a> in Europe. We will study the extent of Palm Oil use is food products in European and North American countries and will try to understand where Palm

				<h2>Consequences</h2>
				<p>Palm Oil is produced in countries which are less economically developed than the countries where the products containing it are sold. This often means the the main producers (Indonesia, Myanmar, ...) have less strict and enforced
					Environmental Policies than western countries. This leads Palm Oil producing Companies to expand their plantations without control. The huge demand for Palm Oil in food products is the cause of a rapid expansion in Palm Oil Plantation's land
					use. This is the reason why Palm Oil is blamed for:</p>

				<h3>Solutions</h3>
				<p>As we saw early, many well know Western and Swiss companies (Nestle, Kellogs, Lindt, ...) massively use Palm Oil in their food products. Consumers should pressure these companies into choosing environmentally friendly palm oil producers which follow strict guidelines about producing palm oil sustainably.</p>

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>In terms of sugar, the problem is quite different in Swizerland and in northern America.</p>
				<p>
					Switzerland is the world biggest chocolate consumer, according to
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_chocolate"> Wikipedia</a>
					or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2015/07/22/the-worlds-biggest-chocolate-consumers-infographic/#3662da084484"> Forbes</a>.
					In Swizerland, there is a some correlation between sugary food chocolate, and Nestle.
					The keywords of Nestle products is quite close to the keywords of sugary snacks in Swizerland: mostly chocolate!
				</p>
				<p>
					In Northern America, the sugary snacks are more various: examples include popcorn, biscuits, and candies.
					Surprisingly, popcorn is the most common sweetened product! But in average those snacks contains less sugar than chocolate.
				</p>

				<p>From the perspective of the openfoodfacts dataset,
					sugary snacks is probably not the reason why people in the US consume more sugar.
					The main reason could be that most of their casual groceries contains more sugar.
