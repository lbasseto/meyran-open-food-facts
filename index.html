				<h3>Ok, but what's wrong with that?</h3>
				<p>Palm oil is produced in countries which are less economically developed than the countries where the products containing it are sold. This often means the the main producers (Indonesia, Myanmar, ...) have less strict and enforced
					environmental policies than western countries. This leads palm oil producing companies to expand their plantations without control. The huge demand for palm oil in food products is the cause of a rapid expansion in palm oil plantation's land
					use. This is the reason why palm oil is blamed for:</p>

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>In terms of sugar, the problem is quite different in Swizerland and North America.</p>
				<p>
					Switzerland is the world biggest chocolate consumer, according to
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_chocolate"> Wikipedia</a>
					or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2015/07/22/the-worlds-biggest-chocolate-consumers-infographic/#3662da084484">
						Forbes</a>: 11.6 kg per year per capita, roughly 15-20% of the sugar consumed yearly.
					In Swizerland, chocolate represents the large majority of the sugar in our manufactured snacks.
					This is due to some popular companies such as Lindt or Nestl√©, who contributed to the design of today's chocolate.
				</p>
				<p>
					In North America, the sugary snacks are more various:
					surprisingly, popcorn is the most common sweetened product!
					Chocolate is also very present, but other examples include biscuits and candies.
					In average those snacks contain less sugar than those in Switzerland.
				</p>

				<p>From the perspective of the Open Food Facts dataset,
					sugary snacks is probably not the reason why people in the US consume more sugar.
					The main reason is rather that most of their casual groceries contains more sugar.

				<p class="align-left">Looking at the difference between additives available in France and the US, we found that several of these absences could be explained by the fact that France has stricter regulations on additives. HHowever, these additives
