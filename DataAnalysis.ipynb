    "# Quality of food offered in the World\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we explore the [Open Food Facts database](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/). After loading, observing and cleaning the data in part 1, we start our analysis in part 2 with the aim of updating our readme to see if what we wanted to do is feasable. In this second part, we uncover insights about the nutritional quality of food consumed around the world. Food habits vary among countries, we would like to point out which areas offer the least healthy options by observing the products offered there.\n",
    "\n",
    "More particularly, we will look at the following points:\n",
    "* How restrictions concerning additives in different countries affects the presence of these substances in foods around the world. We'll also look at whether banning an ingredient in a certain country reduces its presence in other places?\n",
    "* We will consider the amounts of sugar and fat availble in foods around the world.\n",
    "* We will look at how widespread ingredients like palm oil are."
